This is a medium power view of a skin section from a patient with BT. It shows brown HLA-DR staining in macrophages and in the epidermis. Immunostain with monoclonal antibody 1B5. 

This epidermal staining is not normal. HLA-DR expression by the epidermal cells has been switched on by secretion of cytokines from the underlying granulomatous inflammation. Lymphocytes react to the presence of <I>Mycobacterium leprae </I> antigen by secreting interferon-gamma, which up-regulates HLA-DR expression. 

A similar mechanism may underlie type 1 reaction.
